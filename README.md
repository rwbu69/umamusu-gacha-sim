> Inspired by Uma Musume Pretty Derby with brutal yet engaging gacha mechanics

> [!NOTE]
> This project showcases advanced probability algorithms and psychological engagement systems developed with **IBM Granite AI** for educational and demonstration purposes.

Built with cutting-edge web technologies, this simulator features a **brutal yet fair gacha system** with no traditional pity mechanics, instead relying on intelligent probability scaling and psychological feedback systems to maintain player engagement while preserving the authentic thrill of gacha gaming.

## ‚ú® What's Special About This Project?

Unlike traditional flat-rate gacha simulators, our system implements **sophisticated psychological mechanics** commonly found in commercial gacha games. The system uses advanced probability algorithms, streak-based multipliers, and near-miss detection to create an engaging and realistic gacha experience.

> [!TIP]
> **Enhanced Algorithm Features:**
> 
> The simulator goes beyond simple probability rolls by implementing cumulative probability distribution, dual streak tracking, pattern analysis, and psychological manipulation techniques that mirror real-world gacha systems.

This means the **Uma Musume Gacha Simulator** provides an authentic gacha experience with mathematical precision, featuring brutal base rates (0.7% SSR) while maintaining psychological engagement through intelligent rate scaling and visual feedback systems.
