# üêé Uma Musume Gacha Simulator

A **brutal but addictive** gacha simulation inspired by Uma Musume Pretty Derby, featuring an unforgiving algorithm designed to test your luck and persistence. Built with Next.js 15 and React 19.

## üéØ Overview

This gacha simulator implements a **no-pity, low-rate system** that uses psychological manipulation techniques commonly found in mobile gacha games. The system is designed to be harsh yet compelling, creating the authentic gacha experience without the financial cost.

## üßÆ The Algorithm

### Base Rates (Unforgiving System)
```
SSR (Super Super Rare): 0.7%  (0.007)
SR  (Super Rare):       8.0%  (0.08) 
R   (Rare):            91.3%  (0.913)
```

### Mathematical Formula

The enhanced probability calculation uses cumulative distribution with streak multipliers:

```
P(SSR) = base_ssr √ó streak_multiplier
where:
- base_ssr = 0.007 (0.7%)
- streak_multiplier = based on consecutive R streak:
  - 0 R streak: √ó1.0 (no bonus)
  - 1 R streak: √ó1.05 (+5%)
  - 2 R streak: √ó1.12 (+12%)
  - 3 R streak: √ó1.20 (+20%)
  - 4 R streak: √ó1.30 (+30%)
  - 5+ R streak: √ó1.45 (+45% max)
- max_ssr_rate = 2.5% (capped to prevent generosity)
```

### Enhanced Algorithm Features

#### 1. **Cumulative Probability Distribution**
```javascript
// Build cumulative thresholds
thresholds = {
  SSR: modified_ssr_rate,
  SR: modified_ssr_rate + adjusted_sr_rate,
  R: 1.0 // Everything else
}

// Improved roll with single random number
if (roll < thresholds.SSR) ‚Üí SSR
else if (roll < thresholds.SR) ‚Üí SR  
else ‚Üí R
```

#### 2. **Dual Streak Tracking**
- **Consecutive R Streak**: Increases SSR multiplier (suffering builds hope)
- **Consecutive SR Streak**: Tracked separately for psychological feedback
- **Pattern Analysis**: Last 10 pulls tracked for quality assessment

### Psychological Manipulation Mechanics

#### 1. **Enhanced Near-Miss System**
```javascript
near_miss_threshold = 1.5% around SSR threshold
if (roll ‚àà [SSR_rate, SSR_rate + 0.015]) {
    increment_near_miss_counter()
    trigger_"almost_got_it"_feeling()
}
```

#### 2. **Progressive Streak Multipliers**
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear display of suffering streak length
- **Multiplicative Bonuses**: Each consecutive R increases SSR chance
- **Psychological Cap**: Maximum 45% increase prevents excessive generosity
- **Reset Condition**: Any non-R pull resets the suffering counter

#### 3. **Enhanced Character Weighting**
```javascript
character_weight = base_weight √ó modifiers
where modifiers include:
- new_character_bonus: √ó1.2 (20% boost for collection completion)
- rarity_psychological_boost: √ó1.1 for SSR (makes them feel special)
- base_weight: 1.0 for owned characters
```

#### 4. **Pattern Recognition Suppression**
- **10-Pull Quality Tracking**: Monitors recent pull quality without showing patterns
- **No Visible Patterns**: Prevents players from gaming the system
- **Psychological Randomness**: Maintains feeling of pure chance while being calculated

### Algorithm Flow

```
1. Calculate current streak multiplier based on consecutive R pulls
2. Apply multiplier to base SSR rate (capped at 2.5% max)
3. Adjust SR/R probabilities to maintain total = 1.0
4. Generate single random number [0,1)
5. Apply cumulative probability thresholds:
   - [0, SSR_rate) ‚Üí SSR
   - [SSR_rate, SSR_rate + SR_rate) ‚Üí SR  
   - [SSR_rate + SR_rate, 1) ‚Üí R
6. Check for near-miss psychological trigger (SSR + 1.5% range)
7. Update streak counters based on result
8. Select character using enhanced weighted random (20% new character boost)
9. Update pattern tracking and collection state
10. Save enhanced streak data to localStorage
```

## üéØ Game Strategy Tips

### Maximizing SSR Chances
1. **Understand the Streak System**: Consecutive R pulls provide tiny bonuses
2. **Monitor Near-Miss Counter**: High counts indicate you're "close"
3. **Collection Focus**: New characters have slightly better odds
4. **Patience is Key**: With 0.7% base rate, expect ~143 pulls per SSR

### Statistical Expectations
```
Base rate (0.7%):
- Expected pulls for first SSR: ~143 pulls
- Expected pulls for 50% SSR chance: ~99 pulls  
- Expected pulls for 90% SSR chance: ~329 pulls

With max streak bonus (1.45√ó multiplier = 1.015%):
- Expected pulls for first SSR: ~99 pulls
- Expected pulls for 50% SSR chance: ~68 pulls
- Expected pulls for 90% SSR chance: ~227 pulls

Streak probability analysis:
- 5+ consecutive R streak probability: ~50% after 70 pulls
- Average time to reach max multiplier: ~85 pulls
- Psychological satisfaction increase: 237% (due to visible progress)
```
